.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a basic imitation of a command line interpreter that reads and implements basic commands from user input as a shell would.
.PP
.B hsh
 is compiled on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with gcc (C89). It is built to run in both interactive and noninteractive mode.
.PP
.SH USER INPUT
Once a user inputs a command and hits enter, the shell performs the following actions:

1. Splits the command into an array of words.

2. Looks for the command.

3. Executes the command.
.PP
.SH SEARCH FOR COMMAND
When locating a command, the shell looks for a built-in command by that name.
If a built-in command is not found, the shell searches for the command in the PATH.
.PP
.SH EXECUTE COMMAND
Commands are executed in a child process of the main process.
.PP
.SH BUILTINS
.IP env
Prints out all environment variables
.IP exit
Exits process and frees memory allocated.
.PP
.SH BUGS
There are memory leaks when exiting the shell.
This will be fixed in a later version of this shell.
