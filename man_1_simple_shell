NAME
    ./hsh
	Open a simple UNIX command interpreter.
DESCRIPTION
    A simple UNIX command interpreter is a minimalist program designed to read commands entered by a user, interpret them, and then execute them. 
    This type of interpreter operates in a loop, where it waits for user input, parses the command (e.g., splitting it into commands and arguments), 
    and then executes it using system calls like exec. 
    It also handles basic errors and may support simple features such as input/output redirection and chained commands using operators like ||.
EXAMPLES
    ./hsh
    ($) ls
    hsh main.c shell.c
    ($)
    ($) exit

                          hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
